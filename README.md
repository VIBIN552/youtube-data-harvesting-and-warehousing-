### YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

This project focuses on collecting, storing, analyzing, and visualizing YouTube channel and video data using YouTube Data API, PostgreSQL, Streamlit, and Pandas.

Project Overview

This project allows users to harvest data from YouTube using the YouTube Data API and store it in a PostgreSQL database for analysis. The data can be visualized and explored using a Streamlit dashboard, which also allows for querying specific metrics. The goal is to facilitate easy data extraction, transformation, and visualization for YouTube analytics.
